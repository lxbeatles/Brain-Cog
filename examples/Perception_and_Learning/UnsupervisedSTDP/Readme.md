This is an example of training Unsupervised STDP-based spiking neural network. We used a STB-STDP algrithom to train SNN, and mutiply adaptive mechanisms.
 
# How to run
python codef.py

# Result
We train the model on Mnist and FashionMNIST, and the best accuracy for MNIST is 97.9%, for FashionMNIST is 87.0%.
