# Drosophila-inspired decision-making SNN

## Run
 "drosophila.py"  includes the training phase and testing phase.

```shell
python drosophila.py
```
* Training Phase

green-upright T is safe and blue-inverted T is dangerous

* Testing Phase 

For linear pathway and nonlinear pathway, choose between blue-upright T and green-inverted T, and count the PI values under different color intensity

## Results

The following picture shows the linear (a) and nonlinear (b) pathways, the training and testing phases (c), and the PI values on different color intensities (d).
