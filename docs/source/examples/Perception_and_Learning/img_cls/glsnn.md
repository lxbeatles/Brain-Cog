# SNN with global feedback connections
Training deep spiking neural network with the global 
feedback connections and the local optimization learning rules. And is a little different from our original paper. 

## Results
```shell
python cls_glsnn.py
```
We train the model for 100 epochs, and the best accuracy for MNIST is 98.23\%, for FashionMNIST is 89.68\%.
